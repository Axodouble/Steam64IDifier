# a simple discord bot to convert steam links to steam64ids.
A very simple bot in nodejs, purely for what was described above.
Simply set the `.env` variables, get your steam api key here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

test the bot: [invite the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1193657153509138474&permissions=68608&scope=applications.commands+bot)

# docker support
Yeah, it supports docker, just set the env variables for the token and the steam_api key.
